1. Rust is a compiled, statically typed language originally developed by Mozilla. Its main goal is to let you write fast software while preventing common bugs, especially memory-related ones.
2. Why Rust is Special.
--> Memory Safety Without a Garbage Collector

Most languages choose one:
C/C++ → fast, but unsafe.
Java / Python → safe, but slower due to garbage collection

👉 Rust gives you both:
No garbage collector
Memory safety enforced at compile time

This is done using Rust’s ownership system.
====================================================================
--> Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes (Core Ideas)

These rules ensure memory safety:
Ownership: Every value has one owner.
Borrowing: You can have references, but with strict rules
Lifetimes: The compiler checks that references never outlive data

This prevents:
Null pointer dereferences
Use-after-free bugs
Data races
===================================================================
--> Extremely Fast Performance

Rust performance is comparable to C and C++ because:
It compiles to native machine code
There’s no runtime overhead

That’s why it’s used in:
Operating systems, Game engines, Browsers
===================================================================
--> Fearless Concurrency

Rust makes multi-threading safer by design:
Data races are compile-time errors
Thread safety is enforced by the type system

This makes concurrent code much more reliable.
==================================================================
--> Great Tooling

Rust comes with excellent built-in tools:
cargo – package manager & build system
rustfmt – automatic code formatting
clippy – smart linter
rustup – toolchain manager
===============================================================

What Is Rust Used For?

Systems programming (OS kernels, drivers)
Web backends (using frameworks like Actix or Axum)
Command-line tools
Game engines
Blockchain & crypto
Embedded devices
WebAssembly (Wasm)

Companies using Rust include Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Discord, and Cloudflare.
